# Go Tournament Organizer

The goal of this project is to provide a simple way of organizing tournaments for games like Go, Chess or similar. 
It was created because we saw the need of a simpler way to record results in a tournament than to have several people write their result down on a piece of paper just that another person has to type all result into the computer. So this project wants to create an easy way for participants of such an event to insert their results immediately to the system, which will work with these.
